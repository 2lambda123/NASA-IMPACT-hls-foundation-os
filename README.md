# hls-foundation-os
This repository includes the foundation model architecture of Prithvi, a first-of-its-kind temporal Vision transformer pretrained by the IBM and NASA team on continental US Harmonised Landsat Sentinel 2 (HLS) data. This is contained in the `hls-gfm` folder, alongside all the relevant info on how to obtain the pre-trained weights through Hugging Face. 
This repo also contains a practical implementation of finetuning Prithvi to flood detection as an example of a specific downstream application. This is based on the open-access [sen1floods11 dataset](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11) and the open source [MMSegmentation Pytorch wrapper library](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation). This is contained in the `sen1floods11` folder.
